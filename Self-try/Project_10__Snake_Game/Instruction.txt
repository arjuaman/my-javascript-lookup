Github repositories do not include the "node_module" dependancy folders, so in the Terminal run:

    npm i   

And then to build the game.js, in the Terminal run:

    npm run build

Webpack will then compile the Typescript into Javascript and bundle all the files into a single dist/game.js  

In the Terminal run:

    cd dist

Your Terminal is pointing to the dist/ folder you can run:

    http-server (Make sure to install it globally)

Copy the link provided in the Terminal, in my case its: [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)
